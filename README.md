# Rpi-pikiss-binary
Holding place for binary files from Pikiss to use on RetroPie

i was given the ok to use the binarys with my install scripts from Jose Cerrejon who is the one who run PiKiss.

I do not and will never take credit for any of his work. 
I take full credit for my install scripts on getting them working on RetroPie
